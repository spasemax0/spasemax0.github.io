        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I am a computer science enthusiast with a passion for innovation and a knack for bringing complex designs to life. My journey through technology has been diverse and enriching, driving me to constantly prototype new ideas and solutions, especially in the
        realm of cybersecurity. Whether its red team strategies or blue team defenses, I thrive on automating and improving security practices to keep ahead of the curve. Beyond security, I delve into web and game development, exploring some of the more creative aspects of coding.
        I also enjoy messing with machine learning projects and seeing what boundaries can be pushed through the implementation of Artificial Intelligence. While I do love computer science, my interests expand beyond that. I am a published writer as well as a musician, playing 9 instruments in total.
        I feel this creative side is what has helped me excel in computer science, and I enjoy to watch all of my interests collide in some of the more creative aspects in computer science. Overall, I enjoy many things, and I welcome you to my portfolio. A showcase of my journey, achievements, and the endless possibilites
        that lie at the intersection of technology, art, and imagination.</p>
