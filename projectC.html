      <h1>Raspberry Pi Pico USB HID Device using PicoDucky</h1>
      <p>This is a Rubber Ducky USB device made with a raspberry pi pico microcontroller and dbisu's pico-ducky repo on github. This device can emulate a HID device using ducky script. Ducky script is similar to any other scripting language, with the documentation accessible online it is quite easy to learn, meaning you can program this usb device to act as a keyboard, for example. When you plug this device into a computer, it will start typing or using the keyboard commands that are preprogrammed into it at a much faster rate than anyone I personally know can type. Super useful for the purpose of task automation without access to the CLI or any peripherals. </p>
