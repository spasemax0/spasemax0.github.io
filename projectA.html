      <h1>Automated Red Team Toolkit with Raspberry Pi</h1>
      <p>This is an automated red team toolkit utilizing a raspberry pi 4 and a raspberry pi pico microcontroller, as well as differing adapters for wifi and bluetooth sniffing such as the ubertooth one or the alfa wireless adapter (see images). This raspberry pi computer has been flashed with the Kali Linux operating system which is full of a variety of CLI tools that can be used for penetration testing, such as wireshark or nmap. In combination with a set of wireless/bluetooth sniffing adapters, this becomes a very powerful tool, using encrypted SSH to communicate over a cellular device via a given key or using the raspberry pi pico rubber ducky usb to automate tasks with various payloads when plugged in this becomes a penetration tool like no other that is affordable, powerful, and portable. </p>
